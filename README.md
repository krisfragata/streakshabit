current functionality 5/7/21
* currently, user can sign up and register but nothing is saved server side. Currently learning how to implement MongooseDB and node.js to have log in functionality
* after registration, user can click "start game" and as of now, player is simply a square box that can move left to right and jump using the A, D and Space-bar respectively.
* code was inspired by Frank Poth in his platform-game in javascript tutorials on Youtube -- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opiWzi0KWjs
* I wish to recreate his game engine and have disected his code to determine its elements and purpose
